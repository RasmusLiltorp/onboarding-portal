## Header and Footer
- [ ] Create a header using the correct HTML tags
  - *How I did it:* 
I created the header as a Laravel component in resources/views/components/header.blade.php
These components can either be class-based or anonymous.
I chose to create it as an anonymous component, since it's a simple header without any logic.
Then, I included the component in the main layout file resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
