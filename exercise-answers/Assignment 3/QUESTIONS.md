## Question 1: Security & CRUD Operations

### Why is it important to restrict actions in the first place?

### How do you hide restricted actions from even appearing on the website?

### How do you ensure *smart* users cannot send requests to restricted actions?

### How do you validate (i.e., test) that you are restricting actions?

---

## Question 2: Performance, Scalability, & Greenability

### How can you validate the performance of the application? In other words, what steps must you take to ensure the application is ready according to its needs?

### When do you need to scale your application? If necessary, how would you consider scaling your application for your specific use case? Is there any configuration you should change?

### How does performance relate to greenability? What changes would you make to your application (code, configuration, deployment, etc) to ensure it is running *green*?

## Question 3: REST

### Why is your current application not *RESTful*?

### What changes do you need to apply to make it *RESTful*?

### Considering that we use sessions to store authenticated users, how do *RESTful* applications impact this feature? Is it even possible to have authenticated users? Why?
